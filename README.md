## C++ Projects
Projects I have worked on both for and outside of school using the C++ language.

### Cost of Goods Comparison 

This program compares the cost of goods from Costco to either Amazon or Hy-Vee based on a userâ€™s input. It uses files with goods and prices from each of the stores to save and compare values of the total prices. Then, it returns which store will be cheaper and where you will find the better deals. Aside from fstream, this program uses if statements, while loops, for loops, and strings. This allowed me to learn how to take data from multiple files and use it in my programs.

### Dice Game

This program is a two-player dice game in which players roll dice and choose whether or not to reroll any of their dice to increase their round score. The player with highest score after three rounds wins the game. It uses several functions to reroll and print the dice to the screen, as well as calculate and keep track of the score. On top of this, there are many if statements, while loops, and for loops that are used to make the program work. This honed my ability to create a program where it is easy for the user to read, understand, and input their own data.

### Meeting Scheduler

This program determines a one-hour meeting time for a group of students based on availability of students and which times they prefer. All of the information is read in from files. The program then stores and uses these values to display the time blocks with the minimum conflicts and maximum preferences. It does this by using arrays of values based on the information read from the provided files. This taught me several new ways to use and compare different arrays of data.

### Molar Weight Calculator

This program calculates the molar weight of a molecule using a chemical formula provided by the user. It uses a periodic table file that contains the molar weight of individual molecules. Specifically, it will find the molecules that the user inputted and calculate the appropriate total weight for the number of each molecule in the chemical formula. Aside from file input and strings, this program uses if statements and for loops to pull strings apart and separate them into chemical names or numerical values that are used for different things. This program taught me how to manipulate user inputted data so that it can be compared to data already included in the program.
